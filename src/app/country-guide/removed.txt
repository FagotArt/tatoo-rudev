        <Section title="Before Your Tattoo">
          &#x2022; Get a good night’s sleep and stay hydrated
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; Avoid thinning your blood by avoiding alcohol, and caffeine
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; Wear comfortable clothes that allow easy access to the tattoo area. You may also get ink on the clothes you wear so avoid wearing anything you wouldn’t
          want damaged (or light-coloured clothing)
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; Eat a balanced meal and bring snacks for longer sessions
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; Ensure that the area is free from sunburn and free from any flared-up skin conditions.
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; For scar cover-up you must consult the artist prior to ensure the scar has had long enough to heal to be tattooed over.

        <Section title="During a Tattoo">&#x2022; Keep hydrated and feel free to snack to keep your blood sugars up.</Section>
        <Section title="After a Tattoo">
          Your artist will tell you how to take care of our tattoo in the hours and days after your tattoo. Different artists may have slightly different advice. Listen to each
          artist to ensure the best healing process for that tattoo. Consider purchasing the products that the artist or studio sells especially if you are new to tattoos and
          haven’t already been advised by others what you could use.
        </Section>
        <Section title="DO NOT">

          <br />

          <br /> &#x2022; Apply suncream

          <br /> &#x2022; Expose the healing tattoo to direct sunlight (definitely don’t sunbathe)
          <br />
          <br /> &#x2022; Soak your tattoo in water (shower rather than bath if this is an option)

          <br /> <br /> Avoid wearing tight fitting clothes that don’t breathe well
